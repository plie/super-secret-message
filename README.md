# Super Secret Message

**This message will self-destruct!**

My app allows you to send someone an encrypted message that self-dectructs once they view it. You send them a link and a password to unlock the encrypted message. Once it is opened, it self-destructs.

The app generates a token as the path for accessing the message so the URL is not easily guessable,
ie: /284d271fab506b048315 (rather than “/messages/34”)
